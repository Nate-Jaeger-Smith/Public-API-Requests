# Employee Directory App

This is a simple employee directory web application that fetches random employee data from the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays it dynamically. It allows users to search for specific employees by name and view detailed information about them in a modal window.

## Features

- Users can search for employees by entering their names in the search bar.
- Clicking on an employee card opens a modal window with more detailed information about the selected employee.
- The modal window allows users to navigate through the employee list using "Prev" and "Next" buttons.
- Modal "Prev" and "Next" buttons will navigate through searched results if an employee was searched for.

## Style changes
